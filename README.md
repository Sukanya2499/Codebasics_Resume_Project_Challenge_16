# Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics 
## "AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the worldâ€™s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions: 
## 1. What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target? 
## 2. What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier? 
## 3. Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions? 
## 4. How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?

# Primary Analysis:
## KPIs:
Average Air Quality Index (AQI) -> 110.14
Average AQI in past six months -> 122.67
Air quality status most of the days -> Satisfactory
Top Pollutant -> PM10
Total Monitoring Station ->501

In the southern Indian states, PM10 emerges as the most prevalent and hazardous pollutant, with PM2.5 also commonly present in most of the states.
Air purifiers targeting this region, initially, should focus on removing PM10 and PM2.5 for greater health impact and user appeal.
