# Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics 
## "AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions: 
## 1. What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target? 
## 2. What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier? 
## 3. Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions? 
## 4. How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?

In the southern Indian states, PM10 emerges as the most prevalent and hazardous pollutant, with PM2.5 also commonly present in most of the states.
Air purifiers targeting this region, initially, should focus on removing PM10 and PM2.5 for greater health impact and user appeal.

<img width="657" height="333" alt="Screenshot (290)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f3e56bd-4da7-4206-9d3d-7d907d22546a" />

Across major metro cities, no significant difference is observed in AQI between weekdays and weekends.
This indicates a persistent indoor and ambient pollution issue, highlighting the need for air purifiers that provide continuous, 24/7 protection.

Air quality consistently worsens from October to January with the highest pollution levels observed in November over the years.

Bengaluru shows relatively better air quality compared to other cities. Focus on promoting entry-level or seasonal air purifiers, targeting health-conscious consumers and vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.

Our data shows a strong correlation between high AQI and disease outbreaks like Dengue, Malaria, and Diarrheal illnesses, particularly in humid, pollutant-heavy regions.
To address this, we recommend a purifier model that:
•	Captures PM2.5/PM10 effectively
•	Includes anti-bacterial/anti-viral filters
•	Offers dehumidifier integration to reduce moisture-related health risks
This positions the product as a health-focused solution

Despite high EV adoption, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra continue to exhibit elevated AQI levels. In contrast, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu demonstrate notably better air quality alongside strong EV adoption. On the other hand, states like Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Arunachal Pradesh maintain cleaner air despite their low EV adoption, indicating that other environmental or geographical factors may also play a significant role.

Among all competitors, Dyson offers the most expensive air purifiers (₹40K–₹60K), but also includes high-grade HEPA and carbon filters, which are crucial for removing PM10 and PM2.5. With advanced features like real-time AQI monitoring, app and voice control, it’s best suited for Tier 1 cities where both affordability and air pollution levels are high.
On the other hand, Mi/Xiaomi and Coway offer strong value-for-money models for Tier 2/3 cities, ideal for households needing efficiency on a budget.

PM₁₀ and NO₂ significantly worsen pediatric asthma, especially in boys under 5, with cases peaking October–December. Even a 10 µg/m³ rise can raise hospital visits by ~1.3–4.3% for PM₁₀ and ~2.4% for NO₂. AQI spikes directly correlate with more asthma-related hospital admissions in children.

Behavior Shifts:
Pollution emergencies significantly boost air purifier searches and purchases—especially during high AQI events (AQI > 300) from October to January in Tier 1 cities—driven by health concerns, media alerts, and reactive consumer behavior.
