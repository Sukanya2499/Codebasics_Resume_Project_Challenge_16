# Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics 
## "AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the worldâ€™s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions: 
## 1. What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target? 
## 2. What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier? 
## 3. Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions? 
## 4. How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?
