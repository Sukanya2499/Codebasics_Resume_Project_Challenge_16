# Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics 
## "AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions: 
## 1. What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target? 
## 2. What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier? 
## 3. Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions? 
## 4. How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?

# Primary Analysis:
## KPIs:
Average Air Quality Index (AQI) -> 110.14
Average AQI in past six months -> 122.67
Air quality status most of the days -> Satisfactory
Top Pollutant -> PM10
Total Monitoring Station ->501
## Top 5 Polluted Areas & Top 5 Cleanest Areas:

Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, JharKhand, West Bengal are the top 5 cleanest states based on avg AQI.

The top and bottom 5 areas by average AQI indicate significant disparity in air quality levels, emphasizing the need for targeted pollution control in high-AQI regions.

In the southern Indian states, PM10 emerges as the most prevalent and hazardous pollutant, with PM2.5 also commonly present in most of the states.
Air purifiers targeting this region, initially, should focus on removing PM10 and PM2.5 for greater health impact and user appeal.

Across major metro cities, no significant difference is observed in AQI between weekdays and weekends.
This indicates a persistent indoor and ambient pollution issue, highlighting the need for air purifiers that provide continuous, 24/7 protection.

Air quality consistently worsens from October to January with the highest pollution levels observed in November over the years.

Bengaluru shows relatively better air quality compared to other cities. Focus on promoting entry-level or seasonal air purifiers, targeting health-conscious consumers and vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.

Our data shows a strong correlation between high AQI and disease outbreaks like Dengue, Malaria, and Diarrheal illnesses, particularly in humid, pollutant-heavy regions.
To address this, we recommend a purifier model that:
•	Captures PM2.5/PM10 effectively
•	Includes anti-bacterial/anti-viral filters
•	Offers dehumidifier integration to reduce moisture-related health risks
This positions the product as a health-focused solution

Despite high EV adoption, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra continue to exhibit elevated AQI levels. In contrast, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu demonstrate notably better air quality alongside strong EV adoption. On the other hand, states like Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Arunachal Pradesh maintain cleaner air despite their low EV adoption, indicating that other environmental or geographical factors may also play a significant role.
